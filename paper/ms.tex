\title{Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS) II: A Jupiter-Sized Planet in IC~2602}

\input{authors.tex}

\begin{abstract}
We report the discovery of the transiting planet TOI 837.01,
a warm Jupiter-sized planet ($R_{\rm p} = 10.XX\,R_\oplus$, $P =
8.YY\,{\rm d}$), with mass less than X.XX $M_{\rm Jup}$.
TOI$\,$837.01 orbits a V=10.6, T=9.9 G-dwarf in IC~2602 (the
``Southern Pleiades'') and is therefore 50 million years old.
We characterize the system using data from the NASA {\it Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite} (TESS), the ESA Gaia mission,
ground-based photometry, and spectroscopy from CTIO1.5/CHIRON,
XXX/FEROS, and AAT/Veloce.
TOI 837.01 joins the growing ranks of adolescent exoplanets orbiting
bright host stars, and is amenable for studies of planetary
atmospheric and orbital evolution.

\subsection{TESS Photometry}
\label{subsec:tess}

\tn\ (GAIA DR2 5251470948229949568) was observed by the
TESS spacecraft from X to Y in two-minute cadence mode.
The star was designated
TIC\,460205581 in the TESS Input Catalog
\citep{stassun_TIC_2018,stassun_TIC8_2019}.
%FIXME make words more original
The pixel data for an
$11\times11$ array surrounding \tn\ were averaged into 2-minute
stacks by the onboard computer.  Each 2048$\times$2048 image from the
CCD was also averaged into 30-minute stacks, and saved as a ``full
frame image'' (FFI).

%FIXME make words more original
The pixel data for an
The 2-minute stacks for \tn\ were reduced to lightcurves by the
Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) at NASA
Ames~\citep{jenkins_tess_2016}.  We mainly used the Presearch Data
Conditioning (PDC) lightcurve.  The PDC lightcurve aperture used
pixels chosen to maximize the SNR of the total flux of the target
\citep{smith_finding_2016}.  Non-astrophysical variability
was removed by fitting out trends common to many stars
\citep{smith_kepler_2012,stumpe_multiscale_2014}.

%FIXME make words more original
As an independent check on the 2-minute SPOC lightcurve, we examined
the lightcurve based upon 30-minute image stacks which was produced as
part of the Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS;
\citealt{bouma_cluster_2019}).  Our CDIPS lightcurve of choice used a
circular aperture with radius 1 pixel.

\section{The Star}
\label{sec:star}

\subsection{The Cluster}
\label{subsec:cluster}

% NOTE: might want a table of all ages

IC~2602 canonically has an age of $30\pm20\,{\rm Myr}$ (CITE: Van
Leeuwen 2009).
Or logage between 7.533 and 7.563	\citep{bossini_age_2019}.

Or Li age of 40-50Myr (David+19, comparison with other Li stars).

Reported mean metallicity values ${\rm [Fe/H]}$ for the cluster range between
slightly super-solar ($0.04\pm0.01$, \citealt{baratella_gaia-eso_2020}) and
slightly sub-solar ($-0.02 \pm 0.02$, \citealt{netopil_metallicity_2016}).

IC~2602 is supervirial, in the sense that the observed stellar velocity
dispersion is larger than the value expected if it were in virial equilibrium
by about a factor of two \citep{bravi_gaia-eso_2018}.


\subsection{Cluster Membership}
\label{subsec:member}

\tn\ has been reported as a member of \cn\ by multiple independent 
investigators \citep{Kharchenko_et_al_2013,cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.
%FIXME FIXME finish these citations

The Gaia kinematics are good; gamma velocity is correct; Li (FEROS +
Veloce) is strong; the rotation period and vsini agree with
sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

\subsubsection{HR Diagram}
\begin{figure*}[t!]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{f7.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ 
  {\bf Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of \tn\ and members of \cn.}
  Members (black circles) were identified by
  \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.  Gray circles are non-member stars
  within 5 standard deviations of the mean \cn\ right ascension,
  declination, and parallax.  $G$ denotes Gaia broadband magnitudes,
  $Bp$ Gaia blue, $Rp$ Gaia red, and $\omega_{\rm as}$ the parallax in
  arcseconds. 
  \label{fig:hr}
	}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} shows a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of \tn\ in
reference to the broader \cn\ cluster, as well as its neighborhood.
Cluster members were identified by \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}
using using Gaia-DR2 positions, proper motions, and parallaxes.  
We included candidate members with formal membership probability
exceeding 10\%.  Save for a few low-mass outliers, most members appear
to be young and coeval.

\tn\ is in its expected position relative to the other members along
the cluster isochrone.  This photometrically limits the presence of
binary companions in the \tn\ system, to a magnitude difference of
perhaps half the brightness of the target star.

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} also suggests that the membership census of \cn\
is incomplete.  We defined the reference ``neighborhood'' as the group
of at most $10^4$ randomly selected non-member stars within 5 standard
deviations of the mean \cn\ right ascension, declination, and
parallax.  We queried Gaia DR2 for these stars using
\texttt{astroquery} \citep{astroquery_2018}.  Many low-mass stars
appear above the main sequence, even though they were not identified
as 5-dimensional kinematic members through the unsupervised
\citet{cantat-gaudin_gaia_2018} membership assignment process.


\subsubsection{Position and Kinematics}

\begin{figure*}[t!]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{f8.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ 
  {\bf Positions and kinematics of \tn\ (star), \cn\ members (black
  circles), and stars in the neighborhood (gray circles).} Members
  were identified by \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.  $\alpha$ denotes
  right ascension, $\delta$ declination, $\pi$ parallax, $\mu_{\rm
  delta}$ and $\mu_{\rm \alpha}$ proper motion in each equatorial
  direction, and ${\rm RV}$ radial velocity reported by Gaia-DR2.  The
  RVs are for unblended spectra of bright stars ($G\lesssim 12$).  The
  proper motion projection ($\mu_{\delta}$ vs{.} $\mu_{\rm
  \alpha}\cos\delta$) highlights the membership selection function.
  \label{fig:full_kinematics}
	}
\end{figure*}

We examine the six-dimensional positions and kinematics in greater
depth in Figure~\ref{fig:full_kinematics}.  The ``neighborhood'' is
defined here identically to as in Figure~\ref{fig:hr}.  The axes
limits for the right ascension, declination, and parallax dimensions
are as in the Gaia archive query.  The axes limits for the proper
motion and radial velocity dimensions are set at the 25$^{\rm th}$ and
75$^{\rm th}$ percentiles, in order to give a sense of the
population's distribution, while excluding outlying points.  The
radial velocities suffer the greatest incompleteness due to the
current $G\approx12$ magnitude limit of the Gaia-DR2 data processing.

Figure~\ref{fig:full_kinematics} provides strong evidence {\it (i)} for the
existence of the \cn\ open cluster and {\it (ii)} for the membership
of \tn\ within \cn.
The only dimension that could perhaps lead to some worry is the
parallax, as \tn\ is one of the closest \cn\ members reported by
\citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.
Fortunately, there are independent means of verifying stellar youth.


\subsubsection{Rotation}

TESS photometric rotation period = 3.5days ish.

vsini = 17.48 $\pm$ 0.15 (CHIRON).

The two agree.

For comparison, gyrochrones would predict X.XX.

This implies sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

\subsubsection{Lithium}

Rafael's co-added FEROS spectra gave a Li doublet equivalent width of
154 milliangstrom (see attached).

As a reminder, Teff=6100K (TICv8). 
Or Teff = 5946 $\pm$ 39 (CHIRON).
Rafael, if you have a better
determination of Teff, it would be helpful!  SpType is early-G,
late-F from your quicklook spectral typing earlier.

Relevant colors are V-K = 1.7,  V-I ~= V-T = 0.7

Summarizing relevant lithium facts:

Lithium depletion for a star of TOI-837's spectral type happens
over timescales >100 Myr (Soderblom+2013). This is because the
convective envelopes are very shallow, so they don't cycle material
down to the >3e6 K core until much later.

Nonetheless, comparison of early-G field stars to e.g., 600 Myr old
Hyads shows that the depletion does happen over gigayear timescales
(Berger+2018, fig 7).

Comparing to the Li EWs measured by Berger+2018 (their Fig 5),
TOI-837 is consistent with being younger than almost all CKS
planet-hosting field stars.

The TOI-837 Li EW measured here (150 milliangstrom) is consistent
with what's seen for stars of similar colors in <100 Myr old moving
groups (Elliott+2016, Fig 11 -- attached).  This is sensible, because
IC 2602 is supposed to be 50 Myr old.


\subsubsection{Literature Membership}
The membership of \tn\ in \cn\ was noted by \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
in what they dubbed ``Group 5''.
Analyzing the clusters of \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
\citet{bochanski_fundamental_2018} fitted the Gaia, 2MASS, and
WISE photometry with MIST isochrones, and reported stellar masses,
radii, metallicities, ages, distances, and extinction for 9754 stars,
including \tn.

\tn\ was also listed as a member of ``Theia 92'' by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.
These authors identified 999 candidate cluster members, and
reported a cluster isochrone age $\log t = 7.55$ with uncertainty
$\approx 0.15\,{\rm dex}$.


\subsection{Stellar Parameters}

\begin{figure}[t!]

    {\bf Spectral energy distribution of \tn\ from archival
    photometry.}
    {\bf Keivan: please describe!}
    \label{fig:sed}
	}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Physical}
 (Lstar, Rstar, Teff, Age and Mstar)

From CHIRON spectra, my current best guess spectroscopic parameters
 are as follows.
 Teff = 5946 +/- 39
 logg = 4.48 +/- 0.03
 feh = -0.065 +/- 0.035
 vsini = 17.48 +/- 0.15

Figure~\ref{fig:sed}.
The SED fit, looking really good with rchi2 = 1.6: 

The fit parameters are: 
Av = 0.20 +/- 0.03
Fbol = 1.967 +/- 0.046 e-9 erg/s/cm2 
Rstar = 1.049 +/- 0.019 Rsun 

From the spectroscopic logg and the above Rstar, we get an independent
mass estimate of 
Mstar = 1.21 +/- 0.10 Msun 
At face value, the mass seems a bit high for the radius, but I'm
guessing that just means the spectroscopic logg is a bit too high. 


\paragraph{Astrometric information}
The RUWE (CITE, CITE) for \tn\ is 1.02, indicative that there are no
obviously present astometric companions.


\subsubsection{Rotation}
Stellar vsini
Stellar rotation

\subsection{RVs}
I don't strongly expect the Veloce RVs or the FEROS ones to lead to a
mass measurement. The reason is that with vsini=17km/s, and 2\%
rotation amplitude signal, we expect an RV RMS of 300m/s at the
Prot=3.5 day rotation period (vsini*rotation amplitude). This is
probably larger than the expected planet signal (100m/s, 8 days).



\section{The Planet}

    are ``Star A'' and ``Star B'', which were eventually excluded as
    being possible sources of the transits.

		{\bf SOAR HRCam contrast limits derived from point-source

      Star A ($\Delta T=4.7$, $\rho=2.3$'' west) is detected in the
      autocorrelation function, in addition to being a resolved Gaia
      source.
      It is co-moving with \tn, and
      its parallax and on-sky position imply that
      it is physically separated from \tn\ by $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$.
		\label{fig:soar}
	}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Transit Fitting}
Simultaneous dip plus rotation period (GP) fit. Use celerite plus PyMC3/exoplanet.
Mention FPP?


\subsection{Validation of \pn}
\label{subsec:validation}

Exclude possibilities:
"The transits are blended from a background, unassociated eclipsing binary
system or transiting exoplanet: We take the same approach outlined in
Vanderburg et al. (2019). In short, if the transits are a blend from the
background system, the true radius ratio is constrained by the ratio of the
ingress time (T12) to the..."


\subsubsection{Visual Binarity}
Figure~\ref{fig:scene} shows the scene.
In the upper panels, the pixels used to measure the background level
in the SPOC lightcurve are indicated with `\texttt{X}' hatching, and
the pixels used in the final lightcurve aperture are shown with
`\texttt{/}' hatching.

Stars brighter than $T=16$, as queried from the Gaia DR2 source
catalog, are shown with orange circles.
The relevant stars for a blend analysis are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tn\ = TIC 460205581 (T=9.9). The target star.
  \item Star A = TIC 847769574 (T=14.6). $2.3$'' west. Proper motions
    and parallax imply it is comoving with \tn, though with a physical
    separation of $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$, it may not be bound.
  \item Star B = TIC 460205587 (T=13.1). $5.4$'' north.  This is a
    giant background star.
\end{itemize}
An additional source, TIC 847769581, is $4.9$'' from the target, but
too faint (T=18.8) to be the source of the observed transit signal.

The Gaia DR2 data for Star A seems somewhat poorly behaved.  While
Star A has $G=15.1$, and $Bp=14.9$, no $Rp$ magnitude is reported.
Correspondingly, no RUWE value is available (CITE).  The astrometric
reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2 / (N-5)$, for $N$ the number of good
astrometric observations) seems rather poor, at $8.6$.  We suspect
that the photometric failure to produce an $Rp$ magnitude, as well as
the poor astrometric fit, are likely due to blending with \tn.

At the angular resolution of the TESS data, if either Star A or Star B
were eclipsing binaries, they could be the sources of the transit
signal.  Coincidence stellar sources below the resolution limit of
Gaia are also a concern (CITE). To rule out these possibilities, we
took a number of approaches.


\subsubsection{High-resolution imaging}

We imaged the system using SOAR-HRCam.
{\bf Carl: please describe}.
Figure~\ref{fig:soar}.
\citet{ziegler_soar_2020}


\subsubsection{TESS analysis}

We examined the CDIPS FFI lightcurves of the target, which are
available on MAST \citep{bouma_cluster_2019}. Three lightcurves are
available, based on photometric apertures with a radius of 1, 1.5, or
2.5 pixels.  In the raw difference-image light-curves, as well as the
PCA-detrended light-curves, dips of depth $\approx$0.35\% are visible,
and their properties do not significantly vary with aperture size.
Within $\approx20$'', the dips are consistent with originating from
the target star.

\subsubsection{Seeing-limited time-series photometry}

%FIXME:
{\bf left off here}
Co-author P{.} Evans obtained a total transit that showed that, within
1.5'', the transit comes from \tn.  We can be even more certain with a
pixel-level analysis. This 2.1 arcsec neighbor is also a mid to late M
dwarf, and bound given the Gaia parallax + proper motion. The transit
duration is rather long for the signal to come from the M dwarf,
rather than the G dwarf.  I think the state of photometric followup
could be improved (there is only one good total transit), but I think
over this month and next we can pull another few partials.

A total eclipse of Ziegler's faint companion would produce a 1.4\%
dip. A 30\% eclipse, more plausible for a NEB scenario, would produce
dips at exactly the right depth (0.4\%).

dmag = 4.7, transit depth is 0.4\%. This dmag converts to a flux
fraction of 0.0132. A 30\% eclipse on T1 could therefore nominally
explain the TESS data.  % (depth_obs = depth_true * flux fraction).

However in the aperture from this green r=2px green LC, say 90\% of the
flux from T1 is excluded. The eclipse on T1 would therefore need to be
much deeper -- in fact, over 100\%. This argument holds as long as at
least 70\% of the flux from T1 is excluded, so I think we're likely in
the clear.



\subsubsection{Summary}

Possible false-positive scenarios are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Neighboring blends}.

  \item {\it Hierarchical blends}.
    Limited by i) FEROS + Veloce RVs, and ii) the star being nicely on the
    cluster HR diagram. Any extra hidden close-in binary stars would
    need to be very low-mass M dwarfs, and then the transit duration
    again helps.

  \item {\it Background blends}.
  Archival imaging (POSS) available in the south?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional Companions}

None of the extra dips in the PDCSAP light-curve (e.g., ``up-down''
spikes at BTJD 1572 and 1601) seem likely to be planetary
We checked that i) they were not present in the SAPFLUX light-curves,
and ii) that they were not present in the CDIPS light-curves (either
raw, or PCA-detrended).

To make this quantitative, we did injection-recovery.
