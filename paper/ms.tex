\begin{abstract}
  We report the discovery of TOI 837.01 and its validation as a
  transiting planet.  We characterize the system using data from the
  NASA TESS mission, the ESA Gaia mission, ground-based photometry,
  and spectroscopy from CHIRON, FEROS, and Veloce.  We find that
  TOI$\,$837 is a $T=9.9$ G0 dwarf in IC 2602 (the ``Southern
  Pleiades'').  The star and validated planet are therefore 30$\pm$15
  million years old.  The planet is warm ($P = 8.32\,{\rm d}$) and
  roughly Jupiter-sized.  However, its transits are grazing: $b >
  0.92$ at 3$\sigma$.  From TESS photometry alone, the planetary size
  lies within 0.58--3.87 $R_{\rm Jup}$, due to the degeneracy between
  the planetary size and the impact parameter of the transit.  From
  radial velocity monitoring, we limit the mass of planet to less than
  2.XX $M_{\rm Jup}$ (3$\sigma$).  Grazing transits are cause for
  concern: they usually are indicative of astrophysical false positive
  scenarios.  Our follow-up data show that such scenarios are highly
  unlikely.  Multi-color photometry requires eclipsing companions to
  have nearly identical color as TOI$\,$837, ruling out hierarchical
  eclipsing binary scenarios.  Background eclipsing binary scenarios
  are limited by speckle imaging, but formally remain a 0.2\%
  possibility.  TOI 837.01 is therefore a validated adolescent
  exoplanet.  Further observations of its stellar obliquity,
  atmosphere, and mass should confirm its planetary nature beyond
  doubt, and could improve our understanding of how the physical and
  orbital properties of exoplanets change in time.

\section{Introduction}

Over the first one hundred million years of their lives, exoplanet
systems are expected to undergo major physical and dynamical changes.
For a typical Sun-like star, the protoplanetary disk disperses within
$\sim$3 million years (CITE IR + sub-mm results).  The planet
formation process presumably finishes within this time for gas giants
(CITE).  The rocky planet population will also be mostly evolved
within $\sim$3 million years (CITE), but may undergo significant
changes over the next $\sim$10-100 million years through giant
impacts.  The Moon, for instance, is thought to have formed when the
solar system was XX million years old through such an impact (CITE).

A number of other processes are thought to happen relatively quickly.
Physical changes in the sizes of planets are expected as they
contract, and as their atmospheres undergo photoevaporation
\citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{Fortney_et_al_2007,Owen_Wu_2013,Fulton_et_al_2017}.  The
relative importance of these two processes is set by the planetary
mass, as well as the radiation environment.  Photoevaporation in
particular can be directly observed in {\it e.g.}, the He 10830\AA\
line (CITE, CITE, He-I or He-II?).  Dynamical changes are expected in
the semi-major axes, eccentricities, and stellar obliquities of young
planets.  When the gas disk is present, the planetary semi-major axis
is thought to change due to viscous coupling (CITE).
High-eccentricity migration processes including planet-planet
scattering (CITE), secular chaos (CITE), and Kozai-Lidov oscillations
(CITE) can also occur.  The circularization timescale is thought to be
such that for any giant planets that migrated early, their orbits
should circularize within 100 million years (CITE).

Finding and studying systems undergoing these evolutionary changes is
a major goal in contemporary exoplanet research.  To identify stars
younger than say 1$\,$Gyr, a number of direct and indirect methods are
available \citep{soderblom_ages_2010}.  The traditional approach is to
isochronally age-date coeval groups of stars, hereafter ``clusters''
\citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{lada_embedded_2003,zuckerman_young_2004,krumholz_star_2019}.
Young field stars can also be identified using age indicators such as
stellar rotation periods, the abundance of photospheric lithium, and
chromospheric diagnostics such as calcium emission and broadband UV
emission.  Studies by for instance \citet{david_discovery_2018} and
G{.}~Zhou et al. (2020, submitted) have combined these methods for
individual field stars.  Many of the latter methods were summarized by
\citet{mamajek_improved_2008}, and have since been calibrated by {\it
e.g.},
\citet{barnes_color-period_2015,meibom_spin-down_2015,angus_calibrating_2015}
and \citet{curtis_tess_2019} for stellar rotation,
\citet{zerjal_chromospherically_2017} for chromospheric activity, and
{\it e.g.}, \citet{berger_identifying_2018} and
\citet{zerjal_galah_2019} for lithium abundances.

A few dozen planets in clusters have been detected, and fewer still
have been closely characterized.  Despite the challenges of
starspot-induced radial velocity (RV) variations, RV surveys found
success in the Hyades, NGC~2523, Praesepe, and M~67
\citep{Sato_et_al_2007,lovis_mayor_2007,Quinn_et_al_2012,Malavolta_et_al_2016,brucalassi_search_2017}.
RV surveys of highly active pre-main sequence stars in Taurus also led
to the youngest hot Jupiters yet reported
\citep{donati_hj_2016,johns-krull_candidate_2016,biddle_k2_2018,flagg_co_2019}.

The transit method was comparatively slow to catch up.  Early deep
transit searches of open clusters by many groups did not yield
definitive planet detections
\citep{mochejska_planets_2005,mochejska_planets_2006,burke_survey_2006,aigrain_monitor_2007,irwin_monitordata_2007,miller_monitor_2008,pepper_photometric_2008,hartman_MMT_IV_2009}.
These searches were typically sensitive to planets larger than
Jupiter, on $\lesssim 3$ day orbital periods.  Hot Jupiter occurrence
rate limits were derived at the $\lesssim 5\%$ level \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{burke_survey_2006,hartman_MMT_IV_2009}.  The modern 0.5-1\%
occurrence rate suggests that these early transit surveys needed a
greater data volume, at higher precision for detection to be possible
\citep{mayor_harps_2011,wright_frequency_2012,howard_planet_2012,petigura_metallicity_2018}.

Kepler observed a large enough number of stars with sufficient
baseline and precision to detect transiting planets in open clusters:
Kepler-66b and 67b, in the gigayear-old NGC~6811
\citep{borucki_kepler_2010,Meibom_et_al_2013}.  Though a broken
reaction wheel ended the prime Kepler mission, the repurposed K2
\citep{howell_k2_2014} switched between fields along the ecliptic
every quarter-year, and was able to observe far more clusters and
young stars.

The discoveries made by K2 through its surveys of Taurus, the Hyades,
Praesepe, and Upper Sco were a major inspiration for the present work
\citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{Mann_K2_25_2016,obermeier_k2_2016,Mann_et_al_2017,vanderburg_zeitVII_2018,ciardi_k2-136_2018,livingston_three_2018,mann_ZEITVI_2018,rizzuto_zeitVIII_2018,livingston_k2-264_2019}.
Observations with K2 convincingly showed that at least some close-in
planets must form within about 10 Myr
\citep{Mann_K2_33b_2016,David_et_al_2017}.  They also led to the first
hints that young planets may in fact be qualtiatively different from
their field counterparts.  For instance, based on its observed mass,
radius, and UV environment, the 700$\,$Myr K2-100b is probably
actively losing its atmosphere, and should become a bare rocky planet
over the next few hundred Myr
\citep{Mann_et_al_2017,barragan_radial_2019}.  The four transiting
planets in V1298~Tau (23$\,$Myr) are also likely to be actively
photoevaporating, and could represent a precursor to Kepler's compact
multiple systems \citep{david_four_2019,david_warm_2019}.

With the aim of advancing the young planet census, we have been using
data from the TESS spacecraft \citep{ricker_transiting_2015} to
perform a Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey
\citep[CDIPS;][]{bouma_cluster_2019}.  Our targets in this survey are
candidate young stars that have been reported in the literature.  At
the time writing, of order $6\times10^5$ light curves from the first
year of TESS observations have been reduced, and are available at
MAST\footnote{\stscilink} through \datasetlink.  Searching these light
curves yielded the candidate transiting planet, \pn, that is the
subject of this analysis.

Section~\ref{sec:observations} describes the identification of the
candidate, and the follow-up observations collected.
Section~\ref{sec:validation} combines these data to assess the
system's false positive probability, and finds that \pn\ is almost
certainly a planet.  Section~\ref{sec:system} presents our knowledge
of the cluster (Section~\ref{subsec:cluster}), the star
(Section~\ref{subsec:star}) and the planet
(Section~\ref{subsec:planet}).  We conclude by discussing avenues for
improved characterization in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.



\section{Identification and Follow-up Observations}
\label{sec:observations}


\subsection{TESS Photometry}
\label{subsec:tess}

    \label{fig:jointphot}
	}
\end{figure*}

\tn\ was observed by TESS from 26 March 2019 until 20 May 2019, during
the tenth and eleventh sectors of science operations
\citep{ricker_transiting_2015}.  The star was designated
TIC\,460205581 in the TESS Input Catalog
\citep{stassun_TIC_2018,stassun_TIC8_2019}.  Pixel data for an
$11\times11$ array surrounding the star were averaged and saved at
2-minute cadence.  The $2048\times2048$ image from the entire CCD was
also averaged into 30-minute stacks, and saved as a ``full frame
image'' (FFI).

The TESS project detected the transits in the 2-minute data and the
community was alerted on 17 June 2019.  While our CDIPS FFI light
curves also show the transits, the 2-minute data have better sampling
cadence, and so we opted to use the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC)
light curve with the default aperture for our
analysis~\citep{smith_kepler_2012,stumpe_multiscale_2014,jenkins_tess_2016,smith_finding_2016}.

Figure~\ref{fig:rawzoom} shows the data.  The dominant modulation
induced by starspots coming into and out of view has a peak-to-peak
amplitude of about 2.3\%, and a period of about 3 days.  The dips
suggestive of a grazing transiting planet recur roughly every 8 days,
and have a depth of about 0.4\%.  A few flares are visible.  A
phase-folded view of the TESS transits with starspot variability
removed is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:jointphot}, and is described in
depth in Section~\ref{subsec:planet}.

%TODO: you must check custom lightkurve apertures, too

%FIXME: this paragraph doesn't really belong here?
We examined the CDIPS FFI light curves of the target, which are
available on MAST \citep{bouma_cluster_2019}. Three light curves are
available, based on photometric apertures with a radius of 1, 1.5, or
2.5 pixels.  In the raw difference-image light-curves, as well as the
PCA-detrended light-curves, dips of depth $\approx$0.35\% are visible,
and their properties do not significantly vary with aperture size.
Within $\approx20$'', the dips are consistent with originating from
the target star.



\subsection{Gaia Astrometry and Imaging}
\label{subsec:gaia}

\begin{figure}[!t]

    brighter stars are larger. The \texttt{X} and \texttt{/} hatches
    show the apertures used to measure the background and target star
    flux, respectively. Dashed lines of constant declination and right
    ascension are shown.  {\it Bottom:} Digitized Sky Survey $R$-band
    image of the same field, with a linear grayscale. The circles show
    apertures of radii 1, 1.5, and 2.25 pixels used in our blend
    analysis (Section~\ref{subsec:validation}).  Two stars of interest
    are ``Star A'' and ``Star B'', which were eventually excluded as
    being possible sources of the transits.
		\label{fig:scene}
	}
\end{figure}

Between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016, the ESA Gaia satellite measured
about 300 billion centroid positions of 1{.}6 billion stars.  The
positions, proper motions, and parallaxes of the brighest 1{.}3
billion were calculated for the second data release (DR2)
\citep{gaia_collaboration_gaia_2016,lindegren_gaiasoln_2018,gaia_collaboration_gaia_2018}.
\tn\ was assigned the Gaia DR2 identifier 5251470948229949568, and had
276 ``good'' astrometric observations. Its brightness was measured in
the $G$, $Rp$, and $Bp$ bands of the Radial Velocity Spectrometer
\citep{cropper_gaia_2018,evans_gaia_2018}.  

The Gaia imaging, reduced to its point-source catalog, provides
the initial context for analyzing the TESS data.  Stars brighter than
$T=16$, as queried from the Gaia DR2 source catalog, are shown with
orange circles in Figure~\ref{fig:scene}, overlaid on the DSS2 plates
and TESS image.  Given its galactic latitude of $b=-6^\circ$, it is
not surprising that the field of \tn\ is crowded.  The resolved stars
that were of immediate concern for our false positive analysis were as
follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tn\ $\equiv$ TIC 460205581 ($T=9.9$). The target star.
  \item Star A $\equiv$ TIC 847769574 ($T=14.6$), $2.3$'' west. The
    proper motions and parallax of this star imply it is comoving with
    \tn, though with a physical separation of $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$,
    it may not be bound.
  \item Star B $\equiv$ TIC 460205587 ($T=13.1$), $5.4$'' north.  The
    Gaia parallax implies this is a giant background star.
\end{itemize}
An additional source, TIC 847769581, is $4.9$'' from the target, but
too faint ($T=18.8$) to be the source of the observed transit signal.

The Gaia DR2 data for Star A seems poorly behaved.  While Star A has
$G=15.1$, and $Bp=14.9$, no $Rp$ magnitude is reported.
Correspondingly, no RUWE\footnote{ See the Gaia DPAC technical note
GAIA-C3-TN-LU-LL-124-01,
\url{http://www.rssd.esa.int/doc_fetch.php?id=3757412}, accessed
2020-06-22. } value is available.
% The astrometric reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2 / (N-5)$, for $N$ the number
% of good astrometric observations) seems rather poor, at $8.6$.
We suspect that the photometric failure to produce an $Rp$ magnitude,
as well as its poor astrometric fit, are likely due to blending with
\tn.

At the $\approx1'$ resolution of the TESS data, if either Star A
or Star B were eclipsing binaries, they could be the sources of the
transit signal.  A detailed analysis of ground-based seeing-limited
photometry was necessary to assess and rule out this possibility
(Section~\ref{subsec:groundphot}).


\subsection{High-Resolution Imaging}
\label{subsec:speckle}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{f6.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ 
    {\bf SOAR HRCam contrast limits derived from point-source
    injection-recovery experiments.} Star A ($\Delta T=4.7$,
    $\rho=2.3$'' west) is detected in the autocorrelation function, in
    addition to being a resolved Gaia source.  It is co-moving with
    \tn, and its parallax and on-sky position imply that it is
    physically separated from \tn\ by $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$.
		\label{fig:soar}
	}
\end{figure}

To determine if any fainter point sources existed closer to \tn\
inside of Gaia's point-source detection limits, we acquired
high-resolution speckle images. We then searched the autocorrelation
functions of these images for peaks indicative of nearby companions.

{\bf Carl TODO: please describe and correct as appropriate}
The observations of \tn\ were initially acquired by
\citet{ziegler_soar_2020} as part of the Southern Astrophysical
Research (SOAR) TESS Survey using the High Resolution Camera (HRCam;
\citealt{tokovinin_ten_2018}).  The HRCam $I$-band filter is described
by \citet{tokovinin_ten_2018}.  The points in Figure~\ref{fig:soar}
show the resulting measured 5-$\sigma$ detectable contrasts.  The
lines are linear smoothing fits between the regimes of the diffraction
limit, the ``knee'' at $\approx 0.2''$, and the slow decrease until
$\approx 1.5''$, beyond which the speckle patterns become
de-correlated.  Star A (TIC 847769574) was detected at the expected
location and brightness contrast, and no additional companions were
found.



\subsection{Ground-based Time-Series Photometric Follow-up}
\label{subsec:groundphot}

We obtained ground-based seeing-limited time series photometric
observations of \tn\ bracketed around the times of transit.  These
observations confirmed that the transits occurred on-target to within
$\approx 2''$, and that they were achromatic. Both features are
essential for our ability to eliminate false-positive scenarios.

\subsubsection{El Sauce 0.36m}

\paragraph{Acquisition}
We observed four transits with the 0.36m at Observatario El Sauce,
located in the R\'io Hurtado Valley in Chile, and operated by
co-author P{.}~Evans.  The observations were obtained in Cousins-R
band on the nights of 1 April 2020 and 26 April 2020, Cousins-I band
on the night of 21 May 2020, and Johnson-B band on the night of 14
June 2020.  The final 14 June transit began shortly after twilight.

{\bf Phil + Karen TODO: please correct as appropriate}
We scheduled the observations using {\bf \texttt{SOFTWARE}} (CITE).
The photometric data were calibrated and extracted using the
\texttt{AstroImageJ} software package
\citep{collins_astroimagej_2017}.  Comparison stars of similar
brightness were used to produce the final light curves, each of which
showed a roughly 4$\,$ppt dip near the expected transit time.
We produced and examined light curves with at custom positions and
with custom aperture sizes, and...

The data were reduced using... (e.g., astroimageJ)

%TODO TODO
% See "TOI-837 : a planet!" thread, May 2020
\paragraph{Custom aperture analysis}
{\bf LGB TODO: Describe custom analysis of apertures. }
"""
While ``Star A'' was detected in the SOAR images, our ground-based
photometry rules it out as a possible source of the eclipse signal
(Section~\ref{subsec:groundphot}).
"""

A total eclipse of Star A would produce a 1.4\%
dip. A 30\% eclipse, more plausible for a NEB scenario, would produce
dips of exactly the right depth (0.4\%).

To assess this possibility with the ground-based photometry, we
produced light curves centered on \tn\ with
circular apertures of radii ranging from 0.7$''$ to 5.1$''$.
We did not detect any statistically significant variation in the depth
of the transits.

We also created light curves with a custom set of $r=2.1''$ apertures
with positions ranging from Star A (2.3$''$ west of \tn) to 2.3$''$
east of \tn.  We did not detect any variation of the transit depth
along this line of light curves, as would be expected if Star A were
the eclipse host.  The apertures east of \tn\ are particularly
constraining, as they exclude over 90\% of the flux from Star A.
The eclipse on Star A would therefore need to be excessively deep to
produce the observed eclipse depth.
We take this to indicate that \tn\ is the source of the transit signal
to within $\approx2.0''$.



\subsubsection{ASTEP400}

{\bf Amaury TODO: please correct as appropriate}
We observed {\bf N} transits with the 0.40m ASTEP 400 telescope at
Concordia Station, located at Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau
\citep{daban_astep_2010}.  ASTEP 400 has a dichroic that sends blue
wavelengths to a guiding camera, and red wavelengths to a filter-free
science camera with wavelength sensitivity roughly akin to R band.
The observations were acquired on the nights of {\bf DATE 1} and {\bf
DATE 2}.  The outdoor temperature was a balmy {\bf XX$^\circ$}.  The
data were reduced using {\bf XX} software, and showed the transit
roughly at the expected time and depth.


\subsection{Spectroscopic Follow-up}
\label{subsec:spectra}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{f3.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
		{\bf Radial velocities.}
		\label{fig:rvs}
	}
\end{figure}

Reconaissance spectroscopic follow-up is an essential step in vetting
planet candidates.  Medium to high-resolution spectra enable physical
characterization of the star and therefore planet.  Reducing multiple
spectra to a radial velocity time-series can enable planet mass
measurements, and also set limits on the mass of any nearby
companions.  Finally, if there are close or bright companions,
reconaissance spectra can also reveal the presence of a secondary set
of stellar lines.

\subsubsection{SMARTS 1.5m / CHIRON}
\label{subsec:chiron}

We acquired nine spectra using CHIRON at the SMARTS 1.5m telescope at
Cerro Tollo Inter-American Observatory, Chile
\citep{tokovinin_chironfiber_2013}.  Six met our signal-to-noise
requirements for radial velocity measurements and stellar parameter
extraction.  We used CHIRON in its image slicer configuration,
yielding a spectral resolution of $\approx 79{,}000$ across
415--880$\,$nm.

{\bf George TODO: please describe the formal secondary line search in
more depth in this paragraph} We searched for secondary lines in the
CHIRON spectra by cross-correlating against a {\bf template of some
kind}.  This rules out lines with flux ratios of $\approx 2\%$, if the
lines are well-separated in velocity.  To derive the star's physical
parameters, we cross-correlated the template against {\bf something},
and used the {\bf \texttt{nameofcode}}.  This yielded:
\begin{align}
  T_{\rm eff}   &= 5946 \pm 39\,{\rm K}, \nonumber \\
  \log g        &= 4.48 \pm 0.03, \nonumber \\
  {\rm [Fe/H] } &= -0.065 \pm 0.035, \nonumber \\
  v \sin i      &= 17.48 \pm 0.15\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}.
\end{align}
These spectroscopic parameters were used in our final analysis of the
system (Section~\ref{sec:system}).  We measured the radial velocities
through a least-squares deconvolution of the observed spectra against
the same synthetic template.  The resulting velocities are given in
Table~\ref{tab:rvs}, and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rvs}.


\subsubsection{FEROS}
We acquired 13 spectra using the FEROS echelle spectrograph, mounted
on the MPG 2.2m telescope at the European Soutern Observatory in La
Sille, Chile \citep{kaufer_commissioning_1999}.  FEROS has a
resolution of $\approx 48{,}000$ across a spectra range of
350--920$\,$nm. It has a remarkably high efficiency of $\approx 20\%$.

We used the dedicated instrument pipeline to extract 1-dimensional,
wavelength calibrated spectra.  To measure radial velocities, {\bf
Rafael TODO: what procedure was used?  What software packages?}.  The
velocities are given in Table~\ref{tab:rvs}, and shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rvs}.



\subsubsection{Veloce}
We acquired 34 spectra over 10 visits of \tn\ with using the Veloce
spectrograph, mounted on the AAT 4.0m telescope at Siding Spring
Observatory near Coonabarabran, Australia \citep{gilbert_veloce_2018}.
In Rosso form, Veloce provides coverage from 600--950$\,$nm at a
spectral resolution of $\approx 80{,}000$.

Many of the exposures were taken in average or poor seeing conditions,
when fiber-to-fiber cross-contamination on the IFU-style fiber feed is
strongest.  To reduce the spectra to velocities, we cross-correlated
against a high S/N template of $\delta$ Pavonis.  The velocity RMS
seen across each visit was hundreds of meters per second, likely due to
uncorrected fiber-to-fiber cross-contamination.  For
analysis purposes, we averaged across each visit, and set the velocity
uncertainties as the standard deviation in the per-visit exposures.
The velocities are given in Table~\ref{tab:rvs}, and shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rvs}.

\end{figure*}

``Validating'' a transiting planet means statistically arguing that
the data are much more likely to be caused by a planet than by other
astrophysical false positives.  The concept of validation has been
developed and calibrated by {\it e.g.},
\citet{torres_modeling_2011,morton_efficient_2012,diaz_pastis_2014,santerne_pastis_2015,morton_false_2016}
and \citet{giacalone_triceratops_2020}.  ``Validation'' is different
from ``confirmation'', which means that there is overwhelming evidence
that the data must be explained by a planet, for instance through
combined transits and a mass measurement.

Assuming the eclipse has been localized to the target star within the
available angular resolution, potential false positive scenarios
include eclipses of a background binary (BEB), eclipses of a
hierarchical companion to the primary star (HEB), and the possibility
that the eclipses of \tn\ are simply caused by a stellar companion,
rather than a planetary one (EB).

Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario} provides a visual summary of the possible
astrophysical false positive scenarios, as well as our ability to rule
them out based on our combined photometry, velocimetry, and imaging.
We proceed by describing each constraint in detail, and then present a
statistical calculation using \texttt{VESPA}
\citep{morton_efficient_2012} to demonstrate that the probability \tn\
is an astrophysical false positive is small enough to consider it
``validated''.



\subsection{Constraints on False Positive Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Transit Depth}
In HEB and BEB scenarios, the flux from \tn\ and the true eclipsing
binary host would blend together, reducing the ``true'' eclipse depth
$\delta_{\rm true}$ to produce the observed depth
$\delta_{\rm obs}$:
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{\rm obs}
  = 
  \delta_{\rm true} \frac{F_{\rm neighbor}}{F_{\rm total}},
\end{equation}
where the total flux and the flux from the neighbor are labelled as
such.  The requirement that the eclipse is produced by stars and that
$\delta_{\rm true} < 0.5$ translates to a bound on the faintest
possible blended companion stars:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta m < -\frac{5}{2} \log_{10} \left( \frac{0.5}{\delta_{\rm obs}} \right).
\end{equation}
For \tn\ ($T=9.93$), this implies that any stellar companion invoked
to explain the transit depth must be brighter than $T=15.07$.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}, we set the spatial limit to 2$''$ based
on the precision at which we have localized the transits using
seeing-limited ground-based photometry.

Typically, the shape of the transits enables this argument to be
scaled to even more restrictive depths \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{seager_unique_2003,vanderburg_hr858_2019,rizzuto_tess_2020}
However, since the transits of \tn\ are grazing, the second and third
contact points do not occur, and the shape of the transit is not
restrictive.

\subsubsection{Speckle Imaging}
The contrast limits obtained through the SOAR $I$-band speckle imaging
(Section~\ref{subsec:speckle}) are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}.  While ``Star A'' was detected in the
SOAR images, our ground-based photometry rules it out as a possible
source of the eclipse signal (Section~\ref{subsec:groundphot}).  To
convert the remaining contrast constraints to limits on the masses of
putative bound companions, we opted to employ the
\citet{baraffe_evolutionary_2003} models for substellar mass objects
and the MIST isochrones for stellar mass objects
\citep{paxton_modules_2011,paxton_modules_2013,paxton_modules_2015,dotter_mesa_2016,choi_mesa_2016}.
We assumed that the system age was 35 Myr, to ensure that companions
would be at a plausible state of contraction.

To convert from theoretical effective temperatures and bolometric
luminosities to expected magnitudes in instrumental bandpasses, we
assumed that all soruces had blackbody spectra.  While this is clearly
a simplification, the custom instrumental bandpasses prevented a fully
consistent stellar evolutionary calculation.  Using the theoretical
stellar parameters and the measured transmission functions
\citep{tokovinin_ten_2018}, we then calculated the apparent magnitude
of putative stellar companions of different masses, and interpolated
to produce the scale shown on the right in
Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}.

\subsubsection{Not SB2}
As described in Section~\ref{subsec:chiron}, we searched the CCFs of
the CHIRON spectra to determine whether \tn\ is double-lined.  For a
stellar companion well-separated in velocity, this typically shows
companions with flux-fractions $F_2/F_1 \gtrsim 2\%$.  For plotting
purposes, in Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario} we have assumed a
flux-fraction limit of 5\% ($\Delta {\rm mag} \approx 3.25$).

\subsubsection{RVs}
The combined radial velocities from FEROS, CHIRON, and Veloce can be
used to place limits on the presence of massive, close-in bounds
companion to \tn.  We derived the relevant limits using
\texttt{radvel} \citep{fulton_radvel_2018}.  We assumed circular
orbits for the massive companion.  We then fitted the RV data for the
semiamplitude, period, time of conjunction, instrument offsets, and
jitter parameters.  We placed a wide log-uniform prior on the
semiamplitude and period to ensure appropriate sampling of the
relevant spaces.  ($\log K \sim \mathcal{U}(1,10^5)$, $\log P \sim
\mathcal{U}(0.1, 10^{15})$).  We converted the resulting posterior in
period and semiamplitude to minimum mass and semi-major axis assuming
Kepler's third law.  The resulting $3\sigma$ limits are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}.

\subsubsection{Multicolor Photometry}
% TODO: this section is ridiculously long. Abbreviate to 2 paragraphs, 3
% at most.

HEB and to a lesser extent BEB scenarios can be limited
by color photometry.
In the absense of color photometry, the most plausible HEB scenarios for TOI
837 involve pairs of eclipsing M dwarfs (Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}).
These eclipses are redder than eclipses of the G-dwarf \tn.
Observations that the transit depth does not decrease
going to blue bands therefore limits the plausibility of these scenarios.

\paragraph{Simple Example}
% SEE June 1, 2020 email in "Re: TOI-837.01" thread
As a simple example, assume $M_2=M_3=0.2M_\odot$ in a twin HEB.
Assume PMS evolution, and
use MIST isochrones for a 35 Myr system to convert between stellar properties. 
Take transmission functions (filters only; no instrument or atmosphere
response) from the SVO filter profile service\footnote{\url{http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/}}.
Integrate up blackbody functions over each bandpass for each star, and
get estimates of the eclipse depths if there were a total eclipse (of
either of the secondary or tertiary) with this set of parameters.  The
apparent eclipse depths in various Bessel and Cousins bandpasses are:
\begin{align}
%FIXME: check these numbers
  \delta_{\rm U_B} &= 5.03\times10^{-4} \ ({\rm Bessel\ U})\nonumber \\
  \delta_{\rm B_B} &= 1.39\times10^{-3}\ ({\rm Bessel\ B})\nonumber \\
  \delta_{\rm V_B} &= 3.31\times10^{-3}\ ({\rm Bessel\ V})\nonumber \\
  \delta_{\rm R_C} &= 5.59\times10^{-3}\ ({\rm Cousins\ R})\nonumber \\
  \delta_{\rm I_C} &= 9.69\times10^{-3}\ ({\rm Cousins\ I})\nonumber \\
  \delta_{\rm T}   &= 9.18\times10^{-3}\ ({\rm TESS})
\end{align}

Our chief interest is the relative depths, because geometry lets all the
depths be scaled to match the observed TESS depth of $\approx$43 ppt.
(In this case, all depths would be scaled down by a multiplicative factor of
2.1).

The crucial point is that the bluest bands--- U and B---are roughly 10
times shallower than TESS-band, because the M dwarf blackbody function
turns over at 2 times longer wavelengths than the G dwarf blackbody
(Wien's law).

Therefore if TOI 837 were a hierarchical eclipsing M dwarf pair,
Phil's two R-band observations should have shown eclipses a factor of
1.64x shallower than TESS observed (so, 24ppt, instead of the ~40ppt
observed). So, the 40 (+/- 10ish) ppt R-band depths seen in Phil's
transits vs TESS-band argue for a planet, but the level of confidence
could probably be improved with U or B.

\paragraph{Limits on Masses of Bound Companions}

With this intuition in place, we derived the limits on masses of bound
hierarchical eclipsing companions as follows.  We assumed that each
system was composed of the primary (\tn), plus a tertiary companion
eclipsing a secondary companion every 8.3 days.

For secondary masses ranging from 0.07 to 1.10 $M_\odot$, and
mass ratios ($M_3/M_2$) from 0.1 to 1, we then 
calculated the observed maximal eclipse depth of Star 3 in front of
Star 2 in a number of bandpasses.
As before, we interpolated between mass, effective temperature, and radius
assuming the MIST isochrones for a 35$\,$Myr old system,
and also assumed that each source had a blackbody spectrum.

We excluded systems for which the maximal eclipse depth in TESS-band
was less than the observed depth ({\it i.e.}, systems for which the tertiary
was too small).
For the systems with maximal eclipse depths in TESS-band greater than
the observed TESS-band depth, we then calculated the multiplicative
factor required to shrink the depth (from the $b=0$ case) to match the
observed eclipse depth in the TESS-band.
We then scaled the depths in each of the other bandpasses by this
fixed geometric factor.

We then asked: given a fixed secondary mass, are there any tertiary
companions for which the expected $\delta_{\rm R_C}$ is larger than
the observed Rc-band depth?
In cases for which the answer was yes, we could not rule out such
hierarchical eclipsing binary systems.
Conversely, we were able to rule out systems
for which at fixed secondary mass no tertiary mass would
enable eclipses (in ${\rm R_C}$-band) of the necessary depth.

For a lower limit on $\delta_{\rm R_C}$ of 30$\,$ppt,
we found that the transition between systems that would produce
eclipses that no matter what were ``too red'', and systems that would
produce eclipses that could be sufficiently blue happens in \tn\ (for
${\rm R_C}$-band) at 0.38$M_\odot$.
The corresponding limit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}.
For a $\delta_{\rm B_J}$ limit of 30$\,$ppt, the corresponding mass
limit is 0.82$M_\odot$.

\paragraph{Limits on Masses of Projected Companions}

Ignoring the effects of interstellar reddening,
the constraint that $M_2 \gtrsim 0.54 M_\odot$ based on
colors applies to background eclipsing binaries as well.
However, the blue eclipses produced by such systems ({\it e.g.}, a background G2V+K6V binary)
can be kept while making the systems fainter by moving them to greater
distances.
The only way to definitively rule out such scenarios is to 
prove that the loss of light is from the target star,
for instance by detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
during a transit.

Such scenarios are somewhat contrived in that since 
no secondary eclipse is observed, they require either
eccentric orbits to avoid secondary eclipses, or else a
background twin binary system at double
the orbital period.

\subsubsection{Gaia}

The ``Gaia'' curve in Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenarios} combines both
point-source detections from imaging, and sources that show an
astrometric excess.  The curve was interpolated from Figure~4 of
\citet{rizzuto_zeitVIII_2018}.  \tn\ has a RUWE statistic of 1.022,
indicative that there are no obviously present astometric companions.
The UWE statistic (square-root of the reduced astrometric $\chi^2$) is
1.38, which is consistent with comparably bright and blue stars
\citep[][Appendix A]{lindegren_gaiasoln_2018}.

% chi2AL is 526.88
% NgAL is 276
% so, well, reduced chi2 is ~2, which seems bad. but it might (in fact,
% probably is) be because of the color-dependent stuff in the Gaia PSF
% model. Most Rp=10 PTFO members had red chi2 of at least 2.
% Also, looking at Lindegren+2018 Fig A.1., sqrt(reduced chi2) ~= 1.4
% is expected.
%
% --> you could still create the same RUWE vs cluster membership
%  diagnostic plot, just to be sure.


\subsubsection{Patient Imaging}

Archival SERC-J and AAO-SES plates are available for the \tn\
field\footnote{\url{https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form}}.
These plates were acquired in 1982 and 1992, respectively.  For high
proper motion stars archival imagery can be used to detect slowly
moving background stars that might be an astrophysical false-positive
source ({\it e.g.}, \citealt{huang_pimen_2018},
\citealt{vanderburg_hr858_2019}).  However \tn\ has only moved
$\approx0.7''$ between 1982 and present, in comparison to the
$\approx2.0''$ FWHM of the target on the plates.  We therefore cannot
resolve it with great confidence from background sources not already
resolved through more modern imaging.


\subsection{False positive probability}

\subsubsection{Summary}

Possible false-positive scenarios are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Neighboring blends}.
    Ruled out to within 2 arcseconds by Phil Evans.

  \item {\it Hierarchical blends}.
    Limited by i) FEROS + Veloce RVs, and ii) speckle imaging. 
    Multicolor photometry also limits.

  At present our data do not rule out the presence of bound companion
    stars from $\approx$10--100$\,$AU, with masses in the range of
    $\approx$0.15--0.25$\,$M$_\odot$ (Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}).
  Roughly 2-3\% of Sun-like stars in the solar neighborhood with
    binary companions have companions in this region of parameter space
  (assuming the Raghavan+2010 CITE log-normal binary
    separation distribution, and a uniform companion mass function.)

  Companion statistics for hierarchical triples are somewhat less 
    robust, but they have been studied, for instance by CITE
    Tokovinin 2014.
  CITE Tokovinin 2014 found that 7\% of Sun-like stars are
    hierarchical triples with two companions in the compact orbit (the
    ``L$_{12}$'' configuration, rather than the ``L$_{11}$''
    configuration of say, $\alpha$~Centauri).
  A priori then, given a Sun-like primary, the probability that it is in a
    hierarchical triple configuration in which the outer orbit
    satisfies the mass and semi-major axis constraints of
    Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario} is $\approx 7\% \times 3\% = 0.2\%$. 
  This is independent of the issue that the inner pair would require
    finely tuned orbital parameters (i) to eclipse, and (ii) to
    be so compact.

		

  \item {\it Background blends}.
	An argument on the a priori probability of background blends follows from
	counting statistics. Within 360 arcseconds, there are 298 T<16 stars in TIC8
	(i.e., Gaia DR2). At 2.0 arcseconds, SOAR archives dmag(I) of 6. Inside of 2
	arcseconds, we expect $\pi r^2 $ times (Nstar per sq arcsec) = 9e-3 T<16 stars.
	Any with T$\gtrsim$15 outside of 0.3 arcseconds would have been detected by
	SOAR, which brings down the expected number of possible hidden sources by a
	factor of a few.  Within 0.3 arcseconds, where SOAR gets worse than dmag(I) of
	3, we expect 2e-4 T<16 stars. So (order of magnitude), background blends would
	be a $\sim$0.1\% coincidence.
	%For the background blend to be {\it eclipsing} would require an additional
	%$\sim$2\% coincidence (CITE Kirk+2017 KEBC).
	%Combining the two probabilities yields a prior probability of $\approx$0.002\%.



\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Cluster}
\label{subsec:cluster}

% NOTE: might want a table of all ages

IC~2602 canonically has an age of $30\pm20\,{\rm Myr}$ (CITE: Van
Leeuwen 2009).
Or logage between 7.533 and 7.563	\citep{bossini_age_2019}.

Or Li age of 40-50Myr (David+19, comparison with other Li stars).

Reported mean metallicity values ${\rm [Fe/H]}$ for the cluster range between
slightly super-solar ($0.04\pm0.01$, \citealt{baratella_gaia-eso_2020}) and
slightly sub-solar ($-0.02 \pm 0.02$, \citealt{netopil_metallicity_2016}).

IC~2602 is supervirial, in the sense that the observed stellar velocity
dispersion is larger than the value expected if it were in virial equilibrium
by about a factor of two \citep{bravi_gaia-eso_2018}.

IC~2602 happens to be near the western edge of the Sco OB2
association, and is relatively close to it in proper motion space
(Damiani+2019).
Damini+2019 also reported evidence for the ongoing evaporation of
\cn, in the form of a diffuse halo of young stars around the central
density cusps.

While \cn\ is older than most known Sco OB2 members,

"""Although IC 2602 does not belong to Sco OB2, it is
spatially and dynamically a close relative, and for this reason
we include it in this work, if even marginally"" (Damiani+2019).
"""We also find that the open cluster IC 2602 has a similar dynamics
to Sco OB2, and its PMS members are currently evaporating and forming
a diffuse (size 10deg) halo around its double-peaked core"""


\subsection{The Star}
\label{subsec:star}
\subsubsection{Cluster Membership}
\label{subsec:member}

\tn\ has been reported as a member of \cn\ by multiple independent 
investigators \citep{Kharchenko_et_al_2013,cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.
%FIXME FIXME finish these citations
%include: Damiani+2019, Cantat-Gaudin+2020 who explicitly listed it as
%IC2602


The Gaia kinematics are good; gamma velocity is correct; Li (FEROS +
Veloce) is strong; the rotation period and vsini agree with
sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

\subsubsection{HR Diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} shows a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of \tn\ in
reference to the broader \cn\ cluster, as well as its neighborhood.
Cluster members were identified by \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}
using using Gaia-DR2 positions, proper motions, and parallaxes.  
We included candidate members with formal membership probability
exceeding 10\%.  Save for a few low-mass outliers, most members appear
to be young and coeval.

\tn\ is in its expected position relative to the other members along
the cluster isochrone.  This photometrically limits the presence of
binary companions in the \tn\ system, to a magnitude difference of
perhaps half the brightness of the target star.

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} also suggests that the membership census of \cn\
is incomplete.  We defined the reference ``neighborhood'' as the group
of at most $10^4$ randomly selected non-member stars within 5 standard
deviations of the mean \cn\ right ascension, declination, and
parallax.  We queried Gaia DR2 for these stars using
\texttt{astroquery} \citep{astroquery_2018}.  Many low-mass stars
appear above the main sequence, even though they were not identified
as 5-dimensional kinematic members through the unsupervised
\citet{cantat-gaudin_gaia_2018} membership assignment process.


\subsubsection{Position and Kinematics}

We examine the six-dimensional positions and kinematics in greater
depth in Figure~\ref{fig:full_kinematics}.  The ``neighborhood'' is
defined here identically to as in Figure~\ref{fig:hr}.  The axes
limits for the right ascension, declination, and parallax dimensions
are as in the Gaia archive query.  The axes limits for the proper
motion and radial velocity dimensions are set at the 25$^{\rm th}$ and
75$^{\rm th}$ percentiles, in order to give a sense of the
population's distribution, while excluding outlying points.  The
radial velocities suffer the greatest incompleteness due to the
current $G\approx12$ magnitude limit of the Gaia-DR2 data processing.

Figure~\ref{fig:full_kinematics} provides strong evidence {\it (i)} for the
existence of the \cn\ open cluster and {\it (ii)} for the membership
of \tn\ within \cn.
The only dimension that could perhaps lead to some worry is the
parallax, as \tn\ is one of the closest \cn\ members reported by
\citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.
Fortunately, there are independent means of verifying stellar youth.


\subsubsection{Rotation}

TESS photometric rotation period = 3.5days ish.
vsini = 17.48 $\pm$ 0.15 (CHIRON).
The two agree.

For comparison, gyrochrones would ``predict'' X.XX.

This implies sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

Figure~\ref{fig:lithium_rotation} compares the stellar rotation period of \tn\ to
periods that have been measured in a number of well-studied open clusters.
\tn\ seems to be gyrochronologically coeval with the Pleiades sequence.

We note that this is still in the ``sub 500 Myr'' range, when classical
Skumanich spin-down is not expected to be happening (why is this the number?).

This agrees with recent empirical results from Rebull et al 2020 and perhaps also 2018(?):
they observed the Taurus foreground (age 30 Myr) and saw that it was 
roughly consistent with the Pleaides.
Upper Sco had a consistent mean, but a much larger scatter.

%NOTE: begs the question... is there a large population of ~30-50 Myr old
% stars for which we could measure the rotation periods, and clarify if the scatter of Upper Sco chills out?


\subsubsection{Lithium}

Rafael's co-added FEROS spectra gave a Li doublet equivalent width of
154 milliangstrom.

Lithium depletion for a star of TOI-837's spectral type happens
over timescales >100 Myr (Soderblom+2013). This is because the
convective envelopes are very shallow, so they don't cycle material
down to the >3e6 K core until much later.

Nonetheless, comparison of early-G field stars to e.g., 600 Myr old
Hyads has shown that the depletion does happen over gigayear timescales
(Berger+2018, fig 7).

Figure~\ref{fig:lithium_rotation} compares our measured \tn\ Li EW 
to stars in the field, and to young open cluster members.
The field star measurements were collected by
\citet{berger_identifying_2018}.
We have shown the points with lithium detections at ${\rm SNR}>3$.
TOI-837 is consistent with being younger than almost all CKS
planet-hosting field stars.

The young open cluster members were selected for the presence of
lithium, as described by \citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018}.
The TOI-837 Li EW measured here (150 milliangstrom) is consistent
with what's seen for stars of similar colors in <100 Myr old moving
groups.
(Elliott+2016, Fig 11 -- attached).  This is sensible, because
IC 2602 is supposed to be 50 Myr old.



\subsubsection{Literature Membership}
The membership of \tn\ in \cn\ was noted by \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
in what they dubbed ``Group 5''.
Analyzing the clusters of \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
\citet{bochanski_fundamental_2018} fitted the Gaia, 2MASS, and
WISE photometry with MIST isochrones, and reported stellar masses,
radii, metallicities, ages, distances, and extinction for 9754 stars,
including \tn.
%Bochanski reported:
%logAge 9.38 +0.42 -0.26
%dist 138.3 +7.0 -7.2
%A_v = 0.27 +0.18 - 0.18
%


\tn\ was also listed as a member of ``Theia 92'' by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.
These authors identified 999 candidate cluster members, and
reported a cluster isochrone age $\log t = 7.55$ with uncertainty
$\approx 0.15\,{\rm dex}$.
They reported an average extinction of Av=0.243 mag.

\subsubsection{Physical}
 (Lstar, Rstar, Teff, Age and Mstar)

From CHIRON spectra, my current best guess spectroscopic parameters
 are as follows.
 Teff = 5946 +/- 39
 logg = 4.48 +/- 0.03
 feh = -0.065 +/- 0.035
 vsini = 17.48 +/- 0.15

Figure~\ref{fig:sed}.
The SED fit, looking really good with rchi2 = 1.6: 

The fit parameters are: 
Av = 0.20 +/- 0.03
Fbol = 1.967 +/- 0.046 e-9 erg/s/cm2 
Rstar = 1.049 +/- 0.019 Rsun 

From the spectroscopic logg and the above Rstar, we get an independent
mass estimate of 
Mstar = 1.21 +/- 0.10 Msun 
At face value, the mass seems a bit high for the radius, but I'm
guessing that just means the spectroscopic logg is a bit too high. 



\subsubsection{Rotation}
Stellar vsini
Stellar rotation

\subsubsection{RVs}
I don't strongly expect the Veloce RVs or the FEROS ones to lead to a
mass measurement. The reason is that with vsini=17km/s, and 2\%
rotation amplitude signal, we expect an RV RMS of 300m/s at the
Prot=3.5 day rotation period (vsini*rotation amplitude). This is
probably larger than the expected planet signal (100m/s, 8 days).




\subsection{The Planet}
\label{subsec:planet}

\subsubsection{Transit Fitting}
Simultaneous dip plus rotation period (GP) fit. Use celerite plus PyMC3/exoplanet.
Mention FPP?

%TODO: describe 0.3-day robust Huber spline (or whatever detrending is
%eventually used)




\subsubsection{Additional Transits}

None of the extra dips in the PDCSAP light-curve (e.g., ``up-down''
spikes at BTJD 1572 and 1601) seem likely to be planetary
We checked that i) they were not present in the SAPFLUX light-curves,
and ii) that they were not present in the CDIPS light-curves (either
raw, or PCA-detrended).

To make this quantitative, we did injection-recovery.



\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\tn\ joins a number of other young planetary systems reported from
TESS, including DS Tuc Ab \citep{newton_tess_2019}, HIP 67522
\citep{rizzuto_tess_2020}, and TOI 1726 \citep{mann_tess_2020}.

Rossiter measurements will confirm.

After, a mass measurement should be worthwhile.

We'll get more TESS data in January(?).
