\title{Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS) II: A
Jupiter-Sized Planet Candidate in IC~2602}

\input{authors.tex}

\begin{abstract}
We report analysis and arguments for the planetary nature of the
  transiting planet TOI 837.01.
We characterize the system using data from the NASA {\it Transiting
  Exoplanet Survey Satellite} (TESS), the ESA Gaia mission,
  ground-based photometry, and spectroscopy from CTIO1.5/CHIRON,
  MPG2.2/FEROS, and AAT/Veloce.
We find that TOI$\,$837 is a $T=9.9$ G-dwarf in IC~2602 (the
``Southern Pleiades''). 
The star is therefore 40$\pm$10 million years old.
The validated planet is warm ($P = 8.YY\,{\rm d}$) and likely
Jupiter-sized. 
However, its transits are grazing: $b > 0.92$ at 3$\sigma$.
From transit photometry alone, the planetary size lies within
0.58--3.87 $R_{\rm Jup}$, due to the degeneracy
between the planetary size and its impact parameter.
From radial velocity monitoring, we find 
that its mass is less than 2.XX $M_{\rm Jup}$ (3$\sigma$).
This mass limit requires the planetary size to be below $\approx$2.X$R_{\rm Jup}$.
Non-planetary explanations for the data, most notably
hierarchical or background eclipsing binaries, are argued to be
highly unlikely on statistical grounds.
TOI 837.01 therefore tentatively joins the ranks of adolescent exoplanets orbiting
bright host stars. Further analysis of its mass, atmosphere, and obliquity could
confirm its planetary nature beyond doubt, and are worthwhile because
young planets do interesting things.

\subsection{TESS Photometry}
\label{subsec:tess}

\tn\ (GAIA DR2 5251470948229949568) was observed by the
TESS spacecraft from X to Y in two-minute cadence mode.
The star was designated
TIC\,460205581 in the TESS Input Catalog
\citep{stassun_TIC_2018,stassun_TIC8_2019}.
%FIXME make words more original
The pixel data for an
$11\times11$ array surrounding \tn\ were averaged into 2-minute
stacks by the onboard computer.  Each 2048$\times$2048 image from the
CCD was also averaged into 30-minute stacks, and saved as a ``full
frame image'' (FFI).

%FIXME make words more original
The pixel data for an
The 2-minute stacks for \tn\ were reduced to lightcurves by the
Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) at NASA
Ames~\citep{jenkins_tess_2016}.  We mainly used the Presearch Data
Conditioning (PDC) lightcurve.  The PDC lightcurve aperture used
pixels chosen to maximize the SNR of the total flux of the target
\citep{smith_finding_2016}.  Non-astrophysical variability
was removed by fitting out trends common to many stars
\citep{smith_kepler_2012,stumpe_multiscale_2014}.

%FIXME make words more original
As an independent check on the 2-minute SPOC lightcurve, we examined
the lightcurve based upon 30-minute image stacks which was produced as
part of the Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS;
\citealt{bouma_cluster_2019}).  Our CDIPS lightcurve of choice used a
circular aperture with radius 1 pixel.

\section{The Star}
\label{sec:star}

\subsection{The Cluster}
\label{subsec:cluster}

% NOTE: might want a table of all ages

IC~2602 canonically has an age of $30\pm20\,{\rm Myr}$ (CITE: Van
Leeuwen 2009).
Or logage between 7.533 and 7.563	\citep{bossini_age_2019}.

Or Li age of 40-50Myr (David+19, comparison with other Li stars).

Reported mean metallicity values ${\rm [Fe/H]}$ for the cluster range between
slightly super-solar ($0.04\pm0.01$, \citealt{baratella_gaia-eso_2020}) and
slightly sub-solar ($-0.02 \pm 0.02$, \citealt{netopil_metallicity_2016}).

IC~2602 is supervirial, in the sense that the observed stellar velocity
dispersion is larger than the value expected if it were in virial equilibrium
by about a factor of two \citep{bravi_gaia-eso_2018}.

"""Although IC 2602 does not belong to Sco OB2, it is
spatially and dynamically a close relative, and for this reason
we include it in this work, if even marginally"" (Damiani+2019).
"""We also find that the open cluster IC 2602 has a similar dynamics
to Sco OB2, and its PMS members are currently evaporating and forming
a diffuse (size 10deg) halo around its double-peaked core"""


\subsection{Cluster Membership}
\label{subsec:member}

\tn\ has been reported as a member of \cn\ by multiple independent 
investigators \citep{Kharchenko_et_al_2013,cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.
%FIXME FIXME finish these citations
%include: Damiani+2019, Cantat-Gaudin+2020 who explicitly listed as
%IC2602


The Gaia kinematics are good; gamma velocity is correct; Li (FEROS +
Veloce) is strong; the rotation period and vsini agree with
sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

\subsubsection{HR Diagram}
\begin{figure*}[t!]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{f7.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ 
  {\bf Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of \tn\ and members of \cn.}
  Members (black circles) were identified by
  \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.  Gray circles are non-member stars
  within 5 standard deviations of the mean \cn\ right ascension,
  declination, and parallax.  $G$ denotes Gaia broadband magnitudes,
  $Bp$ Gaia blue, $Rp$ Gaia red, and $\omega_{\rm as}$ the parallax in
  arcseconds. 
  \label{fig:hr}
	}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} shows a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of \tn\ in
reference to the broader \cn\ cluster, as well as its neighborhood.
Cluster members were identified by \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}
using using Gaia-DR2 positions, proper motions, and parallaxes.  
We included candidate members with formal membership probability
exceeding 10\%.  Save for a few low-mass outliers, most members appear
to be young and coeval.

\tn\ is in its expected position relative to the other members along
the cluster isochrone.  This photometrically limits the presence of
binary companions in the \tn\ system, to a magnitude difference of
perhaps half the brightness of the target star.

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} also suggests that the membership census of \cn\
is incomplete.  We defined the reference ``neighborhood'' as the group
of at most $10^4$ randomly selected non-member stars within 5 standard
deviations of the mean \cn\ right ascension, declination, and
parallax.  We queried Gaia DR2 for these stars using
\texttt{astroquery} \citep{astroquery_2018}.  Many low-mass stars
appear above the main sequence, even though they were not identified
as 5-dimensional kinematic members through the unsupervised
\citet{cantat-gaudin_gaia_2018} membership assignment process.


\subsubsection{Position and Kinematics}

\begin{figure*}[t!]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{f8.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ 
  {\bf Positions and kinematics of \tn\ (star), \cn\ members (black
  circles), and stars in the neighborhood (gray circles).} Members
  were identified by \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.  $\alpha$ denotes
  right ascension, $\delta$ declination, $\pi$ parallax, $\mu_{\rm
  delta}$ and $\mu_{\rm \alpha}$ proper motion in each equatorial
  direction, and ${\rm RV}$ radial velocity reported by Gaia-DR2.  The
  RVs are for unblended spectra of bright stars ($G\lesssim 12$).  The
  proper motion projection ($\mu_{\delta}$ vs{.} $\mu_{\rm
  \alpha}\cos\delta$) highlights the membership selection function.
  \label{fig:full_kinematics}
	}
\end{figure*}

We examine the six-dimensional positions and kinematics in greater
depth in Figure~\ref{fig:full_kinematics}.  The ``neighborhood'' is
defined here identically to as in Figure~\ref{fig:hr}.  The axes
limits for the right ascension, declination, and parallax dimensions
are as in the Gaia archive query.  The axes limits for the proper
motion and radial velocity dimensions are set at the 25$^{\rm th}$ and
75$^{\rm th}$ percentiles, in order to give a sense of the
population's distribution, while excluding outlying points.  The
radial velocities suffer the greatest incompleteness due to the
current $G\approx12$ magnitude limit of the Gaia-DR2 data processing.

Figure~\ref{fig:full_kinematics} provides strong evidence {\it (i)} for the
existence of the \cn\ open cluster and {\it (ii)} for the membership
of \tn\ within \cn.
The only dimension that could perhaps lead to some worry is the
parallax, as \tn\ is one of the closest \cn\ members reported by
\citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}.
Fortunately, there are independent means of verifying stellar youth.


\subsubsection{Rotation}

\begin{figure}[t!]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{f9.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
    {\bf Rotation periods for \tn\ and selected open clusters.}
    The Pleiades (120$\,$Myr), Praesepe (670$\,$Myr), and NGC$\,$6811
    (1000$\,$Myr) are shown.  Their rotation periods were measured by
    \citet{rebull_rotation_2016a,douglas_poking_2017,douglas_k2_2019},
    and \citet{curtis_temporary_2019}, respectively.
    \label{fig:rotation}
	}
\end{figure}

TESS photometric rotation period = 3.5days ish.
vsini = 17.48 $\pm$ 0.15 (CHIRON).
The two agree.

For comparison, gyrochrones would ``predict'' X.XX.

This implies sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

Figure~\ref{fig:rotation} compares the stellar rotation period of \tn\ to
periods that have been measured in a number of well-studied open clusters.
\tn\ seems to be gyrochronologically coeval with the Pleiades sequence.

We note that this is still in the ``sub 500 Myr'' range, when classical
Skumanich spin-down is not expected to be happening (why is this the number?).

This agrees with recent empirical results from Rebull et al 2020 and perhaps also 2018(?):
they observed the Taurus foreground (age 30 Myr) and saw that it was 
roughly consistent with the Pleaides.
Upper Sco had a consistent mean, but a much larger scatter.

%NOTE: begs the question... is there a large population of ~30-50 Myr old
% stars for which we could measure the rotation periods, and clarify if the scatter of Upper Sco chills out?


\subsubsection{Lithium}

\begin{figure}[t!]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{f5.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
    {\bf Lithium 6708\AA\ equivalent widths for \tn, field stars, and
    young open clusters.}
    The field star sample is drawn from Kepler planet hosts,
    and was measured by
    \citet{berger_identifying_2018} using Keck-HIRES.
    The young open clusters members were surveyed by
    \citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018} using the UVES and GIRAFFE
    spectrographs at the ESO VLT.  \citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018}
    found lithium depletion boundary ages for these clusters of
    $37.7^{+5.7}_{-4.8}\,{\rm Myr}$ (NGC$\,$2547) and
    $43.7^{+4.3}_{-3.9}\,{\rm Myr}$ (\cn).
    \label{fig:lithium}
	}
\end{figure}

Rafael's co-added FEROS spectra gave a Li doublet equivalent width of
154 milliangstrom.

Lithium depletion for a star of TOI-837's spectral type happens
over timescales >100 Myr (Soderblom+2013). This is because the
convective envelopes are very shallow, so they don't cycle material
down to the >3e6 K core until much later.

Nonetheless, comparison of early-G field stars to e.g., 600 Myr old
Hyads has shown that the depletion does happen over gigayear timescales
(Berger+2018, fig 7).

Figure~\ref{fig:lithium} compares our measured \tn\ Li EW 
to stars in the field, and to young open cluster members.
The field star measurements were collected by
\citet{berger_identifying_2018}.
We have shown the points with lithium detections at ${\rm SNR}>3$.
TOI-837 is consistent with being younger than almost all CKS
planet-hosting field stars.

The young open cluster members were selected for the presence of
lithium, as described by \citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018}.
The TOI-837 Li EW measured here (150 milliangstrom) is consistent
with what's seen for stars of similar colors in <100 Myr old moving
groups.
(Elliott+2016, Fig 11 -- attached).  This is sensible, because
IC 2602 is supposed to be 50 Myr old.



\subsubsection{Literature Membership}
The membership of \tn\ in \cn\ was noted by \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
in what they dubbed ``Group 5''.
Analyzing the clusters of \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
\citet{bochanski_fundamental_2018} fitted the Gaia, 2MASS, and
WISE photometry with MIST isochrones, and reported stellar masses,
radii, metallicities, ages, distances, and extinction for 9754 stars,
including \tn.
%Bochanski reported:
%logAge 9.38 +0.42 -0.26
%dist 138.3 +7.0 -7.2
%A_v = 0.27 +0.18 - 0.18
%


\tn\ was also listed as a member of ``Theia 92'' by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.
These authors identified 999 candidate cluster members, and
reported a cluster isochrone age $\log t = 7.55$ with uncertainty
$\approx 0.15\,{\rm dex}$.
They reported an average extinction of Av=0.243 mag.


\subsection{Stellar Parameters}

\begin{figure}[t!]

    (photometry + the atmosphere model) used to generate the plot so I
    can regenerate it in a consistent style with the rest of the paper}
    \label{fig:sed}
	}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Physical}
 (Lstar, Rstar, Teff, Age and Mstar)

From CHIRON spectra, my current best guess spectroscopic parameters
 are as follows.
 Teff = 5946 +/- 39
 logg = 4.48 +/- 0.03
 feh = -0.065 +/- 0.035
 vsini = 17.48 +/- 0.15

Figure~\ref{fig:sed}.
The SED fit, looking really good with rchi2 = 1.6: 

The fit parameters are: 
Av = 0.20 +/- 0.03
Fbol = 1.967 +/- 0.046 e-9 erg/s/cm2 
Rstar = 1.049 +/- 0.019 Rsun 

From the spectroscopic logg and the above Rstar, we get an independent
mass estimate of 
Mstar = 1.21 +/- 0.10 Msun 
At face value, the mass seems a bit high for the radius, but I'm
guessing that just means the spectroscopic logg is a bit too high. 


\paragraph{Astrometric information}
The RUWE (CITE, CITE) for \tn\ is 1.02, indicative that there are no
obviously present astometric companions.


\subsubsection{Rotation}
Stellar vsini
Stellar rotation

\subsection{RVs}
I don't strongly expect the Veloce RVs or the FEROS ones to lead to a
mass measurement. The reason is that with vsini=17km/s, and 2\%
rotation amplitude signal, we expect an RV RMS of 300m/s at the
Prot=3.5 day rotation period (vsini*rotation amplitude). This is
probably larger than the expected planet signal (100m/s, 8 days).

\end{figure*}





\subsection{Transit Fitting}
Simultaneous dip plus rotation period (GP) fit. Use celerite plus PyMC3/exoplanet.
Mention FPP?


\subsection{Validation of \pn}
\label{subsec:validation}

"""Validation is the process of statistically arguing that a
transit-like signal is due to a planet rather than an astrophysical
false positive. """
(CITE blender, Torres+04,05,10; vespa Morton 12, 15; pastis Diaz+14
Santerne+15; triceratops Giacalone \& Dressing 20).

Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario} provides a visual summary of
the possible astrophysical false positive scenarios.
If the \tn\ signal is not planetary, it must come from
the near-total eclipse of a background star (a BEB), or else a hierarchical companion
of the primary star (an HEB).
It must also be verified that to the angular
resolution possible, the transit signal originates from
\tn, and not a neighboring star (an NEB).

For these scenarios to be viable, the flux from \tn\ and the true
eclipsing binary host would blend together, reducing the ``true''
eclipse depth $\delta_{\rm true}$ to produce the observed depth
$\delta_{\rm obs}$:
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{\rm obs}
  = 
  \delta_{\rm true} \frac{F_{\rm neighbor}}{F_{\rm total}},
\end{equation}
where the total flux and the flux from the neighbor are labelled as
such.
The requirement that the eclipse is produced by stars
and that $\delta_{\rm true} < 0.5$
translates to a bound on the faintest possible blended companion
stars:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta m < - \frac{5}{2} \log_{10} \left( \frac{0.5}{\delta_{\rm obs}} \right).
\end{equation}
For \tn\ ($T=9.93$), this implies that any star invoked to explain the
transit depth must be brighter than $T=15.07$.

Typically, the shape of the transit enables this argument to be 
scaled to even more restrictive depths (e.g., CITE Vanderburg+2019, Rizzuto+2020, David+2018 1298Tau).
However, since the transits of \tn\ are grazing,
these arguments do not apply.




\subsubsection{Visual Binarity}
Figure~\ref{fig:scene} shows the scene.
In the upper panels, the pixels used to measure the background level
in the SPOC lightcurve are indicated with `\texttt{X}' hatching, and
the pixels used in the final lightcurve aperture are shown with
`\texttt{/}' hatching.

Stars brighter than $T=16$, as queried from the Gaia DR2 source
catalog, are shown with orange circles.
Given its galactic latitude of only $-6^\circ$, it is not surprising
that the field of \tn\ is crowded.
The relevant stars for a blend analysis are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tn\ = TIC 460205581 (T=9.9). The target star.
  \item Star A = TIC 847769574 (T=14.6). $2.3$'' west. Proper motions
    and parallax imply it is comoving with \tn, though with a physical
    separation of $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$, it may not be bound.
  \item Star B = TIC 460205587 (T=13.1). $5.4$'' north.  This is a
    giant background star.
\end{itemize}
An additional source, TIC 847769581, is $4.9$'' from the target, but
too faint (T=18.8) to be the source of the observed transit signal.

The Gaia DR2 data for Star A seems somewhat poorly behaved.  While
Star A has $G=15.1$, and $Bp=14.9$, no $Rp$ magnitude is reported.
Correspondingly, no RUWE value is available (CITE).  The astrometric
reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2 / (N-5)$, for $N$ the number of good
astrometric observations) seems rather poor, at $8.6$.  We suspect
that the photometric failure to produce an $Rp$ magnitude, as well as
the poor astrometric fit, are likely due to blending with \tn.

At the angular resolution of the TESS data, if either Star A or Star B
were eclipsing binaries, they could be the sources of the transit
signal.  Coincidence stellar sources below the resolution limit of
Gaia are also a concern (CITE). To rule out these possibilities, we
took a number of approaches.


\subsubsection{High-resolution imaging}

We imaged the system using SOAR-HRCam.
{\bf Carl: please describe}.
Figure~\ref{fig:soar}.
\citet{ziegler_soar_2020}


\subsubsection{TESS analysis}

We examined the CDIPS FFI lightcurves of the target, which are
available on MAST \citep{bouma_cluster_2019}. Three lightcurves are
available, based on photometric apertures with a radius of 1, 1.5, or
2.5 pixels.  In the raw difference-image light-curves, as well as the
PCA-detrended light-curves, dips of depth $\approx$0.35\% are visible,
and their properties do not significantly vary with aperture size.
Within $\approx20$'', the dips are consistent with originating from
the target star.

\subsubsection{Seeing-limited time-series photometry}

Co-author P{.} Evans obtained a total transit that showed that, within
1.5'', the transit comes from \tn.  We can be even more certain with a
pixel-level analysis. This 2.1 arcsec neighbor is also a mid to late M
dwarf, and bound given the Gaia parallax + proper motion. The transit
duration is rather long for the signal to come from the M dwarf,
rather than the G dwarf.  I think the state of photometric followup
could be improved (there is only one good total transit), but I think
over this month and next we can pull another few partials.

A total eclipse of Ziegler's faint companion would produce a 1.4\%
dip. A 30\% eclipse, more plausible for a NEB scenario, would produce
dips at exactly the right depth (0.4\%).

dmag = 4.7, transit depth is 0.4\%. This dmag converts to a flux
fraction of 0.0132. A 30\% eclipse on T1 could therefore nominally
explain the TESS data.  % (depth_obs = depth_true * flux fraction).

However in the aperture from this green r=2px green LC, say 90\% of the
flux from T1 is excluded. The eclipse on T1 would therefore need to be
much deeper -- in fact, over 100\%. This argument holds as long as at
least 70\% of the flux from T1 is excluded, so I think we're likely in
the clear.



\subsubsection{Summary}

Possible false-positive scenarios are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Neighboring blends}.
    Ruled out to within 2 arcseconds by Phil Evans.

  \item {\it Hierarchical blends}.
    Limited by i) FEROS + Veloce RVs, and ii) speckle imaging. 

  At present our data do not rule out the presence of bound companion
    stars from $\approx$10--100$\,$AU, with masses in the range of
    $\approx$0.1--0.2$\,$M$_\odot$ (Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario}).
  Roughly 2-3\% of Sun-like stars in the solar neighborhood with
    binary companions have companions in this region of parameter space
  (assuming the Raghavan+2010 CITE log-normal binary
    separation distribution, and a uniform companion mass function.)

  Companion statistics for hierarchical triples are somewhat less 
    robust, but they have been studied, for instance by CITE
    Tokovinin 2014.
  CITE Tokovinin 2014 found that 7\% of Sun-like stars are
    hierarchical triples with two companions in the compact orbit (the
    ``L$_{12}$'' configuration, rather than the ``L$_{11}$''
    configuration of say, $\alpha$~Centauri).
  A priori then, given a Sun-like primary, the probability that it is in a
    hierarchical triple configuration in which the outer orbit
    satisfies the mass and semi-major axis constraints of
    Figure~\ref{fig:fpscenario} is $\approx 7\% \times 3\% = 0.2\%$. 
  This is independent of the issue that the inner pair would require
    finely tuned orbital parameters (i) to eclipse, and (ii) to
    be so compact.

		

  \item {\it Background blends}.
	An argument on the a priori probability of background blends follows from
	counting statistics. Within 360 arcseconds, there are 298 T<16 stars in TIC8
	(i.e., Gaia DR2). At 2.0 arcseconds, SOAR archives dmag(I) of 6. Inside of 2
	arcseconds, we expect $\pi r^2 $ times (Nstar per sq arcsec) = 9e-3 T<16 stars.
	Any with T$\gtrsim$15 outside of 0.3 arcseconds would have been detected by
	SOAR, which brings down the expected number of possible hidden sources by a
	factor of a few.  Within 0.3 arcseconds, where SOAR gets worse than dmag(I) of
	3, we expect 2e-4 T<16 stars. So (order of magnitude), background blends would
	be a $\sim$0.1\% coincidence.
	%For the background blend to be {\it eclipsing} would require an additional
	%$\sim$2\% coincidence (CITE Kirk+2017 KEBC).
	%Combining the two probabilities yields a prior probability of $\approx$0.002\%.

    Archival SERC-J and AAO-SES plates are available for the \tn\
    field\footnote{\url{https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form}}.
    These plates were acquired in 1982 and 1992, respectively.
    For high proper motion stars archival imagery can be used to
    detect slowly moving background stars that might be an
    astrophysical false-positive source
    ({\it e.g.}, \citealt{huang_pimen_2018}).
    However \tn\ has only moved $\approx0.7''$ between 1982 and
    present, in comparison to the $\approx2.0''$ FWHM of the target on
    the plates.
    We therefore cannot resolve it with great confidence from
    background sources not already resolved through more modern
    imaging.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional Companions}

None of the extra dips in the PDCSAP light-curve (e.g., ``up-down''
spikes at BTJD 1572 and 1601) seem likely to be planetary
We checked that i) they were not present in the SAPFLUX light-curves,
and ii) that they were not present in the CDIPS light-curves (either
raw, or PCA-detrended).

To make this quantitative, we did injection-recovery.
